Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friend's are in the bathroom getting higher than the empire state
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
Though holes in my apologies
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
